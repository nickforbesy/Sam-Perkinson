                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p style ="text-indent: 25px;">My name is Sam Perkinson. I was born and raised here in Omaha, Nebraska.
                    I am currently a junior in the Heider College of Business working towards a double major in marketing and management. I am the eldest child in my family with a younger brother and a younger sister. Music and movies are two areas that I totally nerd out on without any embarrassment. I have both boating and motorcycle permits which I love to use when the midwest weather cooperates.
                
                </p>
                <p style ="text-indent: 25px;">
                    People are what keep me moving in life. Having conversations with long-time friends and also making a new friend fulfills my every day. I love to not only hear but truly listen to people’s stories. Every person has a unique life, filled with their own highs, lows, wins, and losses.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-section right">
                <h2> Vision: </h2>
                <p style ="text-indent: 25px;">As my campaign slogan says, I am wanting to truly be a student body president for the student body. I have some things on my agenda that I would like to get done from talking with others while also experiencing things that should be addressed.
                But a majority of what I want to do while in office, is doing what the student body wants. </p> <p style ="text-indent: 25px;">I am only one student. I am a junior, man, from the midwest, in the business school. These demographics do not account for everyone on this amazing campus.
                Frequent surveying going out seeking feedback and also having “town hall meetings” are two ways I plan to have constant input to the whole student body. By hosting these “town hall meetings,” I want to host an open forum that any and every student could come to and voice anything they want to, to me and the gathered students. This would bring face-to-face accountability and the ability to talk through problems and hopefully talk through and get to a solution.</p>
